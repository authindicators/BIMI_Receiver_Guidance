.# Abstract

This document is meant to assist receivers or other mailbox providers 
by providing guidance to implementing Brand Indicators for Message 
Identification (BIMI). This document is a companion to the main BIMI 
drafts which should first be consulted and reviewed.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) specification 
introduces a method by which Mail User Agent (MUA, e.g., an email client) 
providers combine DMARC-based message authentication with cryptographic 
methods to ensure the identity of a sender. If the identity is ensured, 
the MUA can then retrieve sender-selected iconography to display within 
the MUA. This displayed iconography grants the sender brand impressions 
via the BIMI-capable MUA, and should be a driving factor for the adoption 
of authenticated email.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14] [@!RFC2119]
[@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Goals for BIMI

As stated in other BIMI drafts, BIMI intends to advance email authentication 
by granting a sending party brand impressions as long as the message 
passes authentication mechanisms and meets other receiver qualifications 
(reputation, encryption, allow listing, et cetera). DMARC currently has wide 
adoption by some of the Internetâ€™s larger brands, but there is still a long 
tail of small-to-medium size brands (and many large ones) that do not have it. 
Because BIMI provides a visual presence in the inbox, and because visual 
impressions are desirable for brands, BIMI provides an incentive for marketers 
to spur DMARC adoption, whereas a concern purely from security may not.

# Should your site implement BIMI?

If your site satisfies the [requirements](#bimi-site-requirements), this is likely a "yes".

As email has evolved over the past three decades, it is no longer a medium of 
merely exchanging text, but of enabling people to build rich experiences on top 
of it. BIMI provides an incentive for brands to send email more securely 
because the desired behavior - a visual imprint in the inbox - first requires 
DMARC adoption. 

# Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this document. 

* MTA
* MUA
* DKIM
* SPF
* DMARC
* Alignment
* Verified Mark Certificate (VMC)
* Recipient Domain
* Sending Domain
* MVA

For definitions of these terms, see the Appendix.

# Site implementations

In order for a site to correctly implement BIMI, the receiver must be able 
to perform the following:

* Validate SPF
* Validate DKIM signatures
* Validate DMARC
* Discover and fetch a BIMI assertion record using DNS
* Fetch a SVG using HTTPS
* Validate a SVG using a profile
* Add Authentication-Results and BIMI-* Headers to a message

Optionally, for a site to correctly implement BIMI Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) 
verification, the receiver must be able to perform the following:

* Fetch a VMC using HTTPS
* Validate a VMC (a new kind of Extended Validation (EV) certificate)
* Extract a SVG from a VMC

A site may wish to implement URI alteration and image caching for hosted recipients. 
By implementing BIMI, a site agrees that through some combination of trust mechanisms, 
it will instruct a BIMI-capable MUA to display the image fetched from a URI within the 
message headers. This URI is created after the MTA authenticates a message, and is also 
able to authenticate the VMC associated with the sending domain.
Discussion of these trust mechanisms is beyond the scope of this document.

# Validation of a BIMI message

## BIMI Site Requirements{#bimi-site-requirements}

In the BIMI specification, a message MUST be authenticated via DMARC. As stated 
in the DMARC draft, this requires that only one of DKIM or SPF must successfully 
pass validation with alignment with the organizational domain in the From: address. 
However, for additional local security measures, a receiving site may 
choose to create additional requirements for senders in order to verify BIMI  (that is, 
indicate to a downstream MUA that it is safe to load a BIMI logo in the email client) 

This may include, but is not limited to:

* Requiring both DKIM and SPF to validate and align with the organizational domain 
  in the From: address (whereas DMARC only requires one of SPF or DKIM to align with 
  the From: domain)
* SPF "strength" requirements (e.g., requiring "-all", disallowing usage of "?all" 
  or not allowing inclusion of overly large address spaces)
* SMTP delivery via TLS
* Feedback Loop registration or other method of registration with the receiving site 
* Domain reputation via a DNS allow list or other reputation system 

These localized requirements are at the discretion of the receiving site. In general, 
the stricter the criteria, the less chance there is of an MUA erroneously showing a 
logo and giving the wrong signal to a user.

Upon receipt of an email, a receiver that implements BIMI should remove or rename any 
previously existing BIMI-* headers other than BIMI-Selector, as they may have come 
from an attacker (as long as the BIMI-Selector is covered by the DKIM signature; if 
not, it should be removed, renamed, or ignored). 

Additionally:

* It may be useful to have messages exiting a site to have those BIMI-* headers removed 
  as well. 
* It is useful for a site that has not implemented BIMI to remove those headers so 
  that an MUA that does make use of those headers would not accidentally display a BIMI 
  image when the message has not been properly authenticated by the email receiver (even 
  though an MUA should not make use of BIMI headers and instead rely upon settings from 
  the mailstore, it is possible that some MUAs will nevertheless use headers 
  without taking appropriate precautions).

## Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Validation

(Currently, see document in Reference below)

# Communicating BIMI results between the MTA and the MUA

In order for a receiver that has implemented BIMI to notify an MUA that it should 
display the images:

* An MTA must verify BIMI, and if it passes, add additional headers containing the logo 
  to be displayed.

The MUA must check to see if a message passed BIMI before loading the BIMI image.

While the MTA MAY stamp BIMI-related information in the message headers, they should not 
be relied upon by an MUA without additional checks to make sure they were added by a 
trusted source, for example, making sure the MTA strips existing headers on ingress, or 
by checking for a bimi pass in a trusted Authentication-Results header.

## Image Retrieval

A core part of the BIMI specification is that the MUA will retrieve an image file to 
display for each BIMI-validated message. There are multiple ways to accomplish this, 
for example:

* In its most basic setup, a BIMI-capable MUA could retrieve the image file directly 
  from the site specified in the BIMI-Location header. 
  
* A BIMI capable MTA will add a header containing the Base64 encoded SVG of the image file. 
  The MUA can use this header to retrieve the already validated image file for display. This 
  is the recommended method of image retrieval as the work of retrieval and validation has 
  already been done by the MTA.

* Other providers may choose to cache the associated images in a local store which could 
  be used as the BIMI resource address in the headers of a BIMI-approved message in a 
  sort of proxy configuration.


## TTL of cached images

In some circumstances it is necessary to cache the images that an MUA would want to load. 
For example, if a domain owner has a short TTL time, it would force the MUA to look it up 
in an unreasonably short period of time. In this case, a receiver may want to set its 
own TTL. 

One option is to set it to several hours, or a day; another option is to set the TTL to 
the same as the expiration period in the VMC that contains the BIMI image. The 
downside is that the caching mechanism might need to check for certificate revocation, and 
then re-fetch images.

## Privacy Concerns

There is some concern that the retrieval of the iconography could result in a privacy leak.  
As the images are retrieved, it's possible that the image provider could track the retrieving 
system in some way. This has implications whether it be the sender or provider that is hosting 
the image. For example, a sender could include a singular selector for a single recipient, or 
a provider could append a tracking string to the image URI in the header.

A receiver may choose to track the number of selectors an organizational domain is permitted to 
use and deny processing if this exceeds a defined limit. Similarly, a receiver may choose to 
track and limit distinct Indicator URLs.

MTAs are encouraged to cache BIMI Records, VMCs, and Indicators to limit tracking. 

MUAs are encouraged to extract Indicators from the BIMI-Indicator header rather than retrieving 
them directly from the source, as doing so will limit any data exposure to the MTA processing 
the message. The BIMI approved SVG profile prohibits an SVG from loading external elements, 
this removes the risk of tracking when an Indicator is shown in the client.

An in-depth discussion of all the potential privacy leaks with respect to loading or embedding 
images is outside the scope of this document.

## Basic flow example

One sample implementation of BIMI by a receiver, who does everything on-the-fly, is as following:

* Upon receipt of a message, the receiver checks to see if the message passes aligned-SPF 
  or DKIM, and DMARC, and ensures that the sending domain has a DMARC policy of `quarantine`
  or `reject` per local receiver policy, while properly applying the appropriate DMARC 
  policy to the message.

* If the message passes prior checks, the receiver will then check to see if the domain 
  in the From: address has a BIMI record (or, if the message has a BIMI-Selector header that 
  is covered by the DKIM-Signature, uses that to do the BIMI query in DNS).

* If a BIMI record is found, the receiver then retrieves the VMC from the location 
  that the BIMI record points to, and attempts to verify the VMC using a trusted root 
  certificate. .

* Upon successful verification of the VMC, the receiver extracts the verified image from 
  the VMC. If the SVG also passes the SVG validation steps then this is a successful BIMI verification. 

* If the BIMI verification fails then the MTA must not indicate to the MUA to show 
  a BIMI image. The MUA MAY show a default image such as a set of initials, or unidentified sender.

* The email receiver then does the rest of its anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing checks as 
  discussed in [Message Classification](#message-classification) below.

* The email receiver then adds the relevant Authentication-Results and BIMI-* headers to the message 
  to signal to the downstream email client that the message passed BIMI and that is safe to load the 
  logo.

* Eventually, the MUA checks the BIMI-* headers, decodes the image in the BIMI-Indicator header, 
 and displays it as the sender photo (or however else it chooses to render the BIMI logo in conjunction 
 with the message).

## Message Classification {#message-classification}

The successful validation of BIMI does NOT indicate that a message is not spam, malware, or phishing.

It is expected that receivers undertake their usual message filtering and classification steps, and 
take the results of these checks into consideration when deciding if a BIMI Indicator should be 
shown to the user.

If classification is preformed before BIMI is evaluated then a receiver MAY CHOOSE to skip BIMI 
processing for that message, in this case they SHOULD add a bimi=skipped entry to the Authentication-Results 
header for that message, and SHOULD add a comment stating the reasons for skipping BIMI processing.

If a message is classified as phishing or malware then the MUA SHOULD NOT display the logo.

If a message is classified as spam (meaning that the message comes from a known 
brand, but contains spammy content), then the email receiver MAY choose not to display the 
logo. 

# Domain Reputation

Receivers are advised to consider incorporating local sources of domain trust intelligence 
into the processes which ultimately determine whether or not BIMI logos are displayed. 
Simply because a sending domain passes BIMI requirements does not mean the images should 
automatically be displayed in the MUA; a site may impose further restrictions based on 
domain reputation. 

One source of additional reputation intelligence could be a platform that the email provider 
has created to calculate domain trust based on historical traffic; another is an explicit list of 
trusted domains that has been curated by an individual provider; a third is a list that is purchased 
from a vendor that might be a pass/fail or a scored list; another option is some mix of any of the 
previous three. 

## Rolling up based upon domain vs organizational domain

BIMI is designed to be able to work on selectors, and so in theory a brand/domain could specify 
multiple BIMI logos and differentiate them on a per-domain (per-selector) basis. The advantage 
for the brand is that they can choose the image they want the user to see depending upon various 
conditions (e.g., seasonal images, regional images, etc.).

However, for an email receiver, it may be easier to roll up BIMI logos on an organizational domain 
basis. One reason may be for the purposes of reputation, another may be for simplifying management 
of images. In this case, it would need to be made clear to brands that this is how the loading of 
BIMI images works. This documentation could live on a postmaster site, under technical documentation, 
or other official page maintained by the receiver. It could then be referred to when sending 
organizations ask about how to on-board to BIMI at the receiver, and provide official guidance about 
the way it works at the site.

If rolling up by organizational domain, then it may make sense to use a "lowest common denominator" 
approach. That is, an organizational domain must meet all the requirements for BIMI, rather than only 
a subdomain. The reason for this is that if sub.brand.com gets an image due to having strong authentication 
policies, but brand.com does not, then this may cause confusion because a user may learn to associate 
sub.brand.com and its image with brand.com; and if brand.com can be spoofed even though sub.brand.com cannot, 
that can lead to users becoming more susceptible to phishing from brand.com.

To alleviate this, receivers may wish to show logos only for domains that have organizational domains with 
strong DMARC policies. Or, if an organizational domain does not have a strong DMARC policy but a subdomain 
does, then it may treat the organizational domain as if it does have a strong DMARC policy so as to prevent 
a phisher or spammer from impersonating the brand or any of its subdomains. 

A strong DMARC policy may be defined as one which has some level of enforcement. ie, a p=quarantine policy with 
an effective pct=100, or a p=reject policy. 

## Resolving disputes

From time to time, disputes may arise between brands where one brand says that another is infringing 
on its logo.

A brand owner would want to have all email receivers stop showing logos for the infringing brand 
because it could damage its own brandâ€™s reputation. However, an email receiver is not necessarily 
in a good position to determine what constitutes legitimate usage of a logo, nor determine ownership 
of a logo, nor may want the legal risk associated with making this determination.

Therefore, email receivers are strongly encouraged to partner with Dispute Resolution Agencies. These 
agencies specialize in copyright infringement resolution. An affected party would then contact the 
Dispute Resolution Agency, rather than the email receiver, who would then make the decision about if 
use of the logo were legitimate. Then, they would publish the result of the dispute publicly where it 
could be viewed by anyone.

MVAs should respect the decision of the courts and any brand found to be infringing ought to be 
added to their list of domains for which BIMI logos are not loaded.  The issuing MVA of the 
infringing brandâ€™s VMC should formally revoke it. However, this is not guaranteed in 
the case of a rogue MVA or a sloppy MVA. Therefore, email receivers should also pay attention to 
the Dispute Resolution Agencies, and any results that they say are infringing should be prevented 
from loading in their email clients. The email receiver should also keep track of how often disputes 
occur and are found against various MVAs, as an MVA with too many disputes ruled against it could be 
evidence of a sloppy MVA or a rogue MVA.

## VMC Root of Trust

VMCs are verified back to their issuing Certificate Authority (CA). Receivers may wish to maintain their 
own list of trusted CAs for BIMI rather than relying on a generally available bundle of trusted Root 
Certificates such as those distributed with browsers or operating systems. The Authindicators Working Group 
will maintain a list of known VMC Root CA Certificates to help bootstrap such a list.

# BIMI Playbook Checklist

There are several factors to consider for email receivers on things that can go wrong; below are 
a handful of considerations:

* Failing to verify a VMC
* Failing to extract an Indicator from a validated VMC
* Failing to validate a SVG against the recommended profile
* Failing to parse a gzipped SVG Indicator
* Failing to load a logo in the email client
+ Failing to access the logo (e.g., permissions errors)
+ Connectivity problems to the logo
* Failing to display a correct logo in the email client
+ Having the wrong logo stored for a brand (i.e., uploading it to a local store but associating 
   it with the wrong brand)
+ Caching a logo for too long after it has updated

There are many reasons why a logo may fail to load; having tools to investigate (logs, headers 
in messages, internal documentation that is clearly written, having the knowledge pushed out 
to multiple escalation channels) is important for investigation.

# Public documentation

## Documentation For Brands: 

It is ideal to publish the criteria that is used by your site to determine when BIMI will 
be displayed. It is fine to say that you use some internal domain reputation metrics as 
additional criteria to determine whether or not a logo should be displayed, and it isnâ€™t 
necessary to give away the exact nature of the algorithm other than to say "You must maintain 
good sending practices."

If you use an explicit allow list, a site may want to list the minimum requirements, and the 
method of applying to be listed.  Similarly, a provider may wish to state what type of 
activity will revoke the decision to display logos previously approved.

## Documentation For Users: 

BIMI is not meant to instill additional trust in messages, and it is important to make 
this known to your users. All messages, even those with logos, should still be treated with 
(mild) skepticism, and any action regarding the message should still be individually evaluated. 
Itâ€™s possible for a site that has a high trust value to become compromised and send fraudulent 
messages that could compromise a userâ€™s system. Ensure your customers have a place that documents 
BIMI and demonstrates how to check messages for fraud.


# Appendix

## Glossary

* MUA - Mail User Agent - The application used to read messages by the end user.  This could
  be a thick client or a web-based application.

* MTA - Mail Transfer Agent - Software used to transfer messages between two systems, typically
  between two sites, using SMTP as the protocol.

* SPF - [Sender Policy Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208) - 
  SPF is a framework that designates which systems should be sending for a given 
  domain.  This can be a list of IPs, CIDRs, or references to DNS records.  As the sender 
  should be controlling their DNS, they should understand which IPs should be sending as 
  their domain.

* DKIM - [DomainKeys Identified Mail](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376) - 
  DKIM is a system by which a chosen set of headers, combined with the message 
  contents, are cryptographically signed, and then validated by the receiving system. 
  Using DNS, the receiving system can retrieve a public key, and then validate the signature 
  within the headers of a message. When implemented properly, the systems responsible for 
  sending the messages for a given domain name should be the only ones capable 
  of creating messages that correctly validates. 

* DMARC - [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489) - 
  DMARC is a message authentication mechanism that works with SPF and DKIM. The 
  BIMI specification requires that a message passes DMARC. In order for a message to pass 
  DMARC, one of SPF or DKIM must successfully validate, and the domain in the From: address 
  must align with the domain that passed SPF or DKIM.

* Alignment - Alignment refers to the organizational domain, as defined by DMARC, of the 
  domain in the From: address being the same as the organizational domain that passed SPF or 
  DKIM. For example, baz.example.com has an organizational domain of example.com; 
  bar.foo.example.com also has an organizational domain of example.com. It aligns with 
  org.example.com, because both have the same organizational domain. A definition of 
  organizational domain and methods of discovery may be found in the [DMARC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489) RFC. 

* MVA - Mark Verifying Authority - An entity that a receiver uses to certify that the
  iconography that they intend to use with BIMI is properly/legally licensed for their use.

* DRA - Dispute Resolution Authority - This organization will moderate between two entities
  that believe they are both entitled to use a logo.  Receivers should then abide by the
  decision of the DRA as it pertains to logo usage in the MUA.

* VMC - Verified Mark Certificate - An Extended Validation Certificate is used in conjunction with BIMI to 
  create a place where information pertaining to iconography for a sending domain can be 
  securely verified. In the case of BIMI, hashes for an MVA-approved set of iconography 
  will be stored in a field within the certificate. This should allow a receiver site to 
  validate the retrieved imagery before putting the BIMI image URI into the message headers.
